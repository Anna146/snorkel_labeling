twist,," Look [here](http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-night/Update%20397/)  Personally I don't like this ending much (in the same way I can never like Mirai Niki ending) because it's cheesy; giving an impression that nothing interesting will go on in their lives afterwards like an eternity of cooking scenes.	     subr_name: fatestaynight
